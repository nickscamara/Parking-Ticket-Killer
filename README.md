# Parking-Ticket-Killer
3rd Place Winner Hackathon - A parking app for android that allow users to avoid parking tickets and receive bonus.

My team and I built an app that shows user near parking spots and let them
pay for the parking. If you park legally you get coins that can be used to get
insurance discounts and prizes. 
It interfaces:
-Google API
-Shine API(Liberty Mutual Insurance).

Login and database system built using **Google Firebase**.
All the UI design was built in Adobe Illustrator.

Let us know how we could have improved. This was made in 24 hours so obviously it is not complete.
